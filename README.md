# Aldi Aditya Nasution - Data Analytics Portfolio
## About
Hi, I’m Aldi — a Civil Engineering graduate from Universitas Pertamina with a solid background in mathematics, statistics, and engineering principles. 

Throughout my academic journey, I frequently worked with data, which sparked my interest in exploring it further. 

Driven by curiosity and the desire to turn that interest into a career, I pursued a professional certification in data analytics through RevoU, a top online learning platform in Indonesia.

I believe in the power of hard work over innate talent and am deeply passionate about uncovering valuable business insights from complex datasets. I’m always eager to learn, open to new challenges, and enjoy connecting with others. My adaptability, curiosity, and dedication help me consistently deliver results and go beyond expectations.
