# Aldi Aditya Nasution - Data Analytics Portfolio
## About
Hi, I’m Aldi — a Civil Engineering graduate from Universitas Pertamina with a solid background in mathematics, statistics, and engineering principles. 

Throughout my academic journey, I frequently worked with data, which sparked my interest in exploring it further. 

Driven by curiosity and the desire to turn that interest into a career, I pursued a professional certification in data analytics through RevoU, a top online learning platform in Indonesia.

I believe in the power of hard work over innate talent and am deeply passionate about uncovering valuable business insights from complex datasets. I’m always eager to learn, open to new challenges, and enjoy connecting with others. My adaptability, curiosity, and dedication help me consistently deliver results and go beyond expectations.

## Portfolio Projects
### Basic Analysis of Brazillian E-Commerce
**Goal:** The main objective of this analysis is to uncover basic-key insights from the dataset, which are later visualized using Tableau.

**Description:** This project focuses on analyzing key sales and performance insights from January 2017 to September 2018, intended for use in an e-commerce dashboard. The data is organized across multiple files, including order items, customers, payments, reviews, products, sellers, and orders datasets. Additionally, several key insights not directly available in the raw data—such as Customer RFM Segmentation, Product Category Review Scores, and Average Seller Shipment Delays—were derived through custom-built queries.

**Skills:** Data Cleaning, Data Analysis, Data Visualization

**Applications:** SQL, Tableau, Google Spreadsheets.
