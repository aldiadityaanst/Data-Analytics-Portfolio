    <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
    <p>Hi, Iâ€™m Aldi â€” a Civil Engineering graduate from Universitas Pertamina with a solid background in mathematics, statistics, and engineering principles.</p>
<p>Throughout my academic journey, I frequently worked with data, which sparked my interest in exploring it further. Driven by curiosity and the desire to turn that interest into a career, I pursued a professional certification in data analytics through RevoU, a top online learning platform in Indonesia.</p>
<p>I believe in the power of hard work over innate talent and am deeply passionate about uncovering valuable business insights from complex datasets. Iâ€™m always eager to learn, open to new challenges, and enjoy connecting with others. My adaptability, curiosity, and dedication help me consistently deliver results and go beyond expectations.

    <h3>ðŸ“Š Brazil E-Commerce Analysis</h3>
    <p>The main objective of this analysis is to uncover basic-key insights from the dataset, which are later visualized using Tableau.</p>
    <p>This project focuses on analyzing key sales and performance insights from January 2017 to September 2018, intended for use in an e-commerce dashboard. The data is organized across multiple files, including order items, customers, payments, reviews, products, sellers, and orders datasets.</p> 
    <p></p>Additionally, several key insights not directly available in the raw dataâ€”such as Customer RFM Segmentation, Product Category Review Scores, and Average Seller Shipment Delaysâ€”were derived through custom-built queries.
